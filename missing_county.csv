2457,NEW IN WRAPPER SCOTTY CAMERON PHANTOM X 5.5 PUTTER 34 INCHES RRP £380 ,"Brand New Still In Cellophane Scotty Cameron Phantom x 5.5 Mallet Putter RRP £380 With Proof Of Purchase  Stunning Looking Putter...34 Inches Long Men`s Right Handed Scotty Cameron has created his most technically advanced line to date with the 2021 Phantom X family – a collection of 9 newly shaped mallet putters. The Phantom X family is a hi-tech putter line, each of the nine models feature a striking and helpful alignment aid, from simple dots to continuous sightlines, raised or stepped down flanges and wider or ""disappearing"" top-lines, these putters are designed to take putting performance to the next level.The Phantom X line replaces the Futura family in the Scotty Cameron range of putters, the nine new mallet styles have different shaft bend and alignment options that are built around five different head shapes - the Phantom X 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12. Each one of the Phantom X putters incorporates a multi-material construction including a precision-milled aluminium face that is integrated with 303 stainless steel heads that have heightened vibration dampening technology, all of this technology maximises the MOI of each one of the putters.Scotty Cameron took his inspiration for the long sightlines on the putters from fast cars and fighter jets, whilst the neon painted dots will help golfers to frame the ball at address. The three shaft options – low-bend, mid-bend and straight – throughout the Phantom X line enables players to determine their desired amount of toe flow (""Toe hang"" is a quality of toe-balanced putters. The clubface of a toe-balanced putter will, when the shaft of the putter is balanced lengthwise across a golfer's finger, be angled toward the ground. In other words, the toe of such a putter will hang down, pointing toward the ground). Phantom X models with a "".5” suffix (i.e. 5.5, 7.5 and 8.5) have a shorter, low-bend shaft contour with one shaft of offset for more toe flow to encourage an arc through the putting path. The Phantom X 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 models have a slightly taller, mid-bend shaft meaning you get a near-face balanced setup that provides less toe flow than the .5 models. Phantom X 5.5:Identical in shape to the Phantom X 5, the 5.5 has a lower shaft bend that aims to offer players enhanced toe flow while still creating an arc in the stroke.Available in 33"", 34"" and 35"" lengths. Each new Phantom X putter features stability weighting with two, customisable stainless steel heel-toe weights and stepless steel shafts. The Phantom X line also features the new Pistolero Plus grip in cement grey with a gloss black paint fill. The Scotty Cameron Phantom X range comes with a new Pistolero Plus Grip which is customised with a thicker, less tapered low hand for performance and feel. ""Phantom X is by far the most high-tech putter line we’ve designed to date” Scotty Cameron said. DESIGN:Scotty Cameron has created his most technically advanced putter line to date with Phantom X—a collection of nine new modern mallets designed and engineered to take putting performance to the next level. Each compact, high-tech model masterfully blends sharp, alignment-promoting angles with soft, sculpted contours exemplifying Scotty’s flowing, melt-into-the-ground design philosophy. ALIGNMENT:Aesthetically stunning with precise visual guides built into every model, Phantom X mallets provide players with a variety of alignment options ranging from triple-milled sight dots to continuous, brightly coloured lines, new flange setups and wider toplines. PERFORMANCE:Made to inspire confidence and promote performance, Phantom X putters are precision milled, multi-component mallets crafted with sleek, ground-hugging contours shaped to offer optimal weight distribution, forgiveness and feel. SOLID PUTTER FACE PERFORMANCE:A milled block of 6061 aluminium extends through the flange area of each model. ManufacturerScotty CameronHead TypeMalletFace TypeMilledShaft TypeSteelWarranty1 YearHeadcover IncludedYes  ",1426716657,Edinburgh,,340.0,"Sports, Leisure & Travel ", Golf Equipment , Clubs,None

2623,COLNAGO SUPER Track FRAME FORKS 1980s FCI COLUMBUS 56cm Campagnolo Roger Garage ,"We are proud to present the chance to build your ideal Time Trial/ Triathalon (TT) Track bike or road bike if TT isn’t your cup of tea.Few bicycles have influenced the scene as much as the Colnago Super. In 1968, when the Super was first released racing bicycles had long wheelbases, flat angles, large tyre clearance and were rather heavy.Ernesto Colnago noticed these flaws and released a bicycle that would revolutionise the world of cycling.Ernesto Colnago designed the Super frameset for high performance using an innovative geometry solution. This new geometry made the Colnago Super significantly stiffer which increased the efficiency of the power transfer from the rider. As well as adapting the new aggressive racing angle, the Colnago Super was also particularly lightweight for the period and it was no surprise that many professionals were keen to ride them. Ernesto Colnago had released a more compact bike that would become legendary and a dream bike for a whole generation of cyclists.Colnago designed this frame for high performance using a different geometry to other manufacturers of the period. The Colnago Super was also stiffer and lighter. It was extremely popular and remained in production for some 30+ yearsBuilt specifically for the velodrome, it was born and raised with speed.Overall condition of the frame is B+ due to the age it has a couple scratches and marks on the frame but nothing major.The frame has received a comprehensive health check - ensuring the structural integrity is intact and safe to ride. In addition to this the frame has received a full clean, detail and a machine polish.Details:Size 56 cmFits 700c wheels, clearance up to 28cColnago DropoutsFeel free to ask any further info or near offers, send us a message!We at Roger Garage Custom Bikes are all about creativity and originality.

Works perfectly. Cash on collection only, I won't post this graphics card. Non-LHR?  All versions of RTX 3060 12gb have some flavour of LHR, but this is the original (rev 1) which can be bypassed if you use the leaked dev driver version 470.05 in Windows.  There are some other rules to follow (you must use a PCIe gen 3 slot at 8x speed or higher, you must connect either a monitor or a dummy hdmi plug).  Then you can mine Ethereum at full hash rate.

5312,Home Storage Synology DS412+ 4-Bay NAS Network Attached Storage RAID Backup Media Documents DSM 6 ,"Synology DS412+ 4-BAY NAS (no hard drives included) Excellent Condition - Fully Tested 100% Working - Factory Reset - Latest Supported Synology DSM System Installed - Very Easy Setup What is included:- Synology DSM 412+ NAS device- Network Cable- Power Supply No hard disks or SSDs included, you can buy and populate the NAS device yourself with 1-4 drives to any supported capacity you require separately. Product Reviews - Tech Power Up ""All in all the DS412+ left me satisfied with its performance, high reliability and especially its nice operating system, which is very easy to use even for inexperienced users. The NAS proved to be astonishingly fast even in RAID 1 mode and surpassed competing QNAP boxes with similar hardware."" ""To sum up, the Synology DS412+ is a highly reliable speed demon, with a ton of features. It is offered at a fair price, which is much lower than the competition, so I have no problem recommending this product to anyone interested in a high performance 4-bay NAS."" Product Overview Synology DiskStation DS412+ is perfect for anyone who requires a high-performance, easy to manage, and full-featured network attached storage solution to centralize data backups, protect critical assets and share files across different platforms.  Features• 205.68 MB/sec Reading, 182.66 MB/sec Writing• 2 LAN with Failover and Link Aggregation Support• Features SuperSpeed USB 3.0• CPU Passive Cooling Technology & System Fan Redundancy• Hot-swappable Hard Drive Design• Windows® ADS and ACL Support• VMware® / Citrix® / Microsoft® Hyper-V® Compliance• Running on Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM 6) Additional Information: Experience High Performance Data Throughput With the Link Aggregation enabled, Synology DS412+ delivers an average 179.15 MB/sec writing speed under RAID 5 configuration in a Windows environment, and 202.36 MB/sec reading. Coming with USB 3.0 support which offers transmission speeds of up to 5 Gbps, namely 10 times faster than USB 2.0, DS412+ takes less time for data transfer for external hard drives and consumes less power. Synology DS412+ brings you the high performance that your data-intensive applications demand for a storage system. Dependable and Reliable Synology DS412+ delivers high data availability to ensure access when it’s needed. The 2 LAN with failover support and hot-swappable drives will ensure continual service uptime should the drives need replacement or the unexpected LAN failure. CPU is the heart of any system, and DS412+ incorporates a passive cooling structure to avoid the dependency of a dedicated processor cooling fan, and mitigate any critical point of failure. When system detects fan fails, the built-in redundancy mechanism will spin up the functional fan to properly ventilate the system, and support continuous operations until the replacement fan arrives. Therefore, potential system damages are minimized and system availability is maximized. Flexible Storage Management The Synology Hybrid RAID (SHR) automatically builds an optimal RAID volume with data protection based on the hard drives installed, eliminating the need to have hard drives of identical size, while still offering a manual setup option for advanced users. Multiple Volumes on RAID allows you to create more than one volume on a RAID structure, providing a flexible and efficient way to manage your storage across all available hard drives. When the need arises to expand the volumes, simply allocate more storage space on the UI, and DSM does the rest for you without any service disruption. Rich Applications Synology DS412+ runs on the award-winning operating system, Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), which offers comprehensive applications and features designed specifically for office and business workgroups. Web Station with PHP/MySQL® support allows a single Synology DS412+ to host up to 30 websites and numerous 3rd party web applications, such as Content Management, Customer Relationship Management & e-Commerce system. The built-in mail server turns Synology DS412+ into a dedicated mail service provider, while the add-on package, Mail Station 2, provides a webmail interface for users to access emails stored on Synology DS412+. Synology Surveillance Station offers a centralized interface to manage IP cameras deployed in your office or home, allowing users traveling miles away to safeguard the environment by watching live views, recording events, and taking snapshots with a computer or mobile device. A wealth of add-on packages allows the Synology DS412+ to replace several pieces of network hardware. For example, the VPN Server offers an easy VPN solution that turns your Synology DS412+ into a VPN server, providing a secure way of connecting to a private LAN at a remote location. Will ship to mainland UK (payment via PayPal Invoice), same-day cash + local delivery/collection preferred, located in London SE10.
